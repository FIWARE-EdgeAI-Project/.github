A FIWARE-powered Edge AI application showcased in the Smart World by FIWARE, demonstrating intelligent edge computing with context-aware AI. 

# FIWARE-EdgeAI-Project

The FIWARE-EdgeAI-Project is a PoC focused on building an Edge AI application powered by the FIWARE platform. 

The goal of this project is to showcase how FIWARE can be leveraged to develop intelligent applications that run at the edge, closer to the data sources (e.g. weather station).

## Key aspects of the project include:

- Leveraging FIWARE's context management capabilities to enable **real-time AI inference** on digital twin data.
- **Deploying AI/ML models at the edge** for low-latency processing and decision-making.
- **Integrating edge devices and sensors** with the FIWARE platform for seamless data collection and actuation.
- Presenting the project's **architecture** and capabilities within the **Smart World by FIWARE** demonstrator.
